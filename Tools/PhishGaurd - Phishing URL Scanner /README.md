# 🛡️ PhishGuard v1.0

PhishGuard is a Python-based tool designed to help detect potential phishing URLs by analyzing various factors such as SSL certificates, domain similarity, and more. This tool aims to provide a comprehensive check against phishing attacks, making it easier for users to verify the legitimacy of a URL.

## 🎯 Features

- **🔒 SSL Certificate Validation**: Checks if the SSL certificate is valid and matches the domain.
- **🔍 Domain Similarity Check**: Compares the URL's domain with known trusted domains using Levenshtein distance.
- **⚠️ Phishing Domain Detection**: Compares the URL against a list of known phishing domains.
- **⏳ Domain Age Check**: Checks the age of the domain to identify newly registered domains, which are often used in phishing attacks.
- **🔗 Suspicious Pattern Detection**: Analyzes the URL for uncommon TLDs and suspicious patterns.
- **🤖 Automatic Scheme Handling**: If a URL is missing `http://` or `https://`, the tool will prompt the user to add it or test with both.
