# 🔴 Red Team Projects

Welcome to the Red Team section of my Cybersecurity Projects repository! This section is dedicated to offensive security, focusing on simulating attacks to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in systems and applications. Below are the various projects categorized under penetration testing, exploit development, and social engineering.

## 📁 Directory Structure

### 🛠️ PenetrationTesting
Projects related to penetration testing, including tools and techniques for identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities.

- **Network Scanning**: Scripts and tools for scanning networks to identify live hosts and open ports.
  - **Port Scanner**: A custom script to scan for open ports on a target network.
- **Web Application Testing**: Tools for testing web applications for vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF.
- **Wireless Testing**: Tools for testing the security of wireless networks.

### 💣 ExploitDevelopment
Projects focused on developing exploits to demonstrate how vulnerabilities can be leveraged by attackers.

- **Buffer Overflow**: Examples and scripts demonstrating buffer overflow attacks.
- **Privilege Escalation**: Techniques and tools for escalating privileges on compromised systems.
- **Custom Exploits**: Custom-developed exploits for known vulnerabilities.
  - **Keylogger**: A custom keylogger script to capture keystrokes on a compromised system.
  - **Spyware**: A custom spyware tool to monitor and capture data from a target system.

### 🕵️ SocialEngineering
Projects related to social engineering attacks, illustrating the psychological manipulation of individuals into performing actions or divulging confidential information.

- **Phishing Campaigns**: Tools and scripts for automating phishing email campaigns.
- **Credential Harvesting**: Tools for capturing credentials through fake login pages.
- **Human Exploitation**: Techniques for exploiting human trust and behavior to gain unauthorized access.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with any of these projects, simply navigate to the relevant directory and follow the instructions provided in the respective `README.md` files. Each project includes detailed documentation on how to set up and use the tools or techniques demonstrated.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

These tools and techniques are intended for educational purposes only. They should only be used in controlled environments where you have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized use of these tools against systems you do not own or have permission to test is illegal and unethical.
